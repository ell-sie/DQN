# DQN Job Opportunities Environment

## Overview
This repository is part of a mission to create job opportunities for women in tech by providing practical, hands-on examples of reinforcement learning. The project involves creating, training, and testing a custom Gym environment where an agent navigates a 5x5 grid to reach a job opportunity while avoiding challenges representing barriers women might face in the tech industry.

## Files
- `job_opportunities_env.py`: Defines the custom Gym environment.
- `train.py`: Script to train the agent using DQN.
- `play.py`: Script to simulate and visualize the agent's performance with the trained model.
- `test_env.py`: A basic script to test the environment and visualize its behavior.

## Installation
To run the code, you'll need to install the following Python packages:
```bash
pip install gym numpy stable-baselines3
